# Japanese Kanji Pronunciation Classifier

## Description

This project fetches kanji from ja.wiktionary.org, organizes their onyomi (Chinese-derived readings), and attempts to present them in a clear order for learners. It is primarily targeted towards East Asian language speakers who are familiar with kanji characters but may not know their Japanese pronunciations.


## Limitations

1. This tool relies on web scraping and may be affected by changes to the structure of ja.wiktionary.org.  Due to inconsistencies and exceptions in the source data, manual adjustments and hardcoded rules are employed. For optimal performance, download all code and data together. Compatibility with future versions of Wiktionary is not guaranteed.

2. This tool is still under development and may have limited functionality.
